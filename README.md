## 📂 Project Structure

```
small-dataset-visualization/
├─ small dataset visualization.ipynb   # Jupyter Notebook with analysis
├─ employee_productivity.csv           # Sample dataset
├─ images/                             # Saved plots
```

## 🛠️ Libraries Used

- `pandas` – for data manipulation  
- `matplotlib` – for plotting and visualization  
- `numpy` – for numerical computations  

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy
```

## 📊 Features

- **Scatter Plot:** Salary vs Productivity (with employee annotations)  
- **Bar Chart:** Department vs Salary (with salary labels)  
- **Scatter Plot:** Experience vs Salary with Trend Line  
- **Correlation Heatmap:** Identify relationships between numerical features  
- **Scatter Matrix (Pair Plot):** Explore distributions and correlations  

All plots are annotated for clarity, making this ideal for **small datasets**.
